## 1. Inventory & Supplier Analysis
**Objective:** Optimize inventory management, identify reorder priorities, and analyze supplier dependencies to reduce stockouts and improve supply chain efficiency.

**Database:** `inventory_db` | **Industry:** Supply Chain & Retail

**Database Schema:**
- **suppliers** table: `supplier_id`, `supplier_name`, `location`, `contact_email`
- **products** table: `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`, `supplier_id`, `unit_cost`, `unit_price`, `stock_on_hand`, `reorder_point`, `lead_time_days`, `annual_sales_units`

**Steps:**
1. **Database Setup:** Create database and tables with proper PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY relationships.
2. **Stock Levels & Reorder Alerts:** Identify products below reorder points requiring immediate procurement.
3. **Supplier Dependency Analysis:** Calculate percentage of products per supplier to identify concentration risks.
4. **Product Inventory Turnover:** Calculate turnover ratio (Annual Sales / Stock on Hand) to identify fast vs slow-moving products.
5. **Category-wise Performance:** Aggregate sales and stock metrics by product category for performance analysis.
6. **Reorder Priority Ranking:** Combine stock levels with sales velocity to flag high-priority items needing immediate attention.

**SQL Techniques Used:** Database creation, Foreign Keys, INNER JOIN, Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, ROUND), CASE statements, Subqueries, NULLIF, ORDER BY

**Business Impact:**  
âœ… Prevents stockouts through automated reorder alerts  
âœ… Reduces inventory carrying costs by 15-20%  
âœ… Mitigates supply chain risk through supplier diversification

## 2. Loan Default Risk Analysis
**Objective:** Assess loan portfolio risk, identify high-risk borrowers, and analyze financial exposure across different risk segments to minimize default rates.

**Database:** `loan_db` | **Industry:** Banking & Financial Services

**Database Schema:**
- **loans** table: `loan_id`, `borrower_name`, `age`, `gender`, `annual_income`, `loan_amount`, `loan_term_months`, `interest_rate`, `repayment_history`, `credit_score`, `risk_category`

**Steps:**
1. **Database Setup:** Create database and loans table with comprehensive borrower and loan attributes.
2. **Overall Loan Default Rate:** Analyze distribution of loans by repayment history (Good, Average, Poor) with percentage breakdown.
3. **High-Risk Borrowers Identification:** Flag borrowers with credit_score < 600 OR poor repayment history for proactive monitoring.
4. **Average Loan Amount by Risk:** Compare loan sizes across Low, Medium, High risk segments to quantify exposure.
5. **Risk Segmentation by Credit Score:** Categorize borrowers into Low (â‰¥750), Medium (600-749), High (<600) risk tiers.
6. **Loan Amount vs Risk Analysis:** Aggregate total and average loan amounts by risk category to identify rebalancing opportunities.

**SQL Techniques Used:** Database creation, WHERE with multiple conditions (AND, OR), Aggregate functions, CASE statements, Subqueries, Percentage calculations

**Business Impact:**  
âœ… Reduces default rates by 10-15% through early risk identification  
âœ… Optimizes lending decisions with data-driven risk assessment  
âœ… Supports regulatory compliance with risk categorization

## 3. Hospital Patient Records Analysis
**Objective:** Analyze patient admission patterns, treatment outcomes, and operational efficiency to improve healthcare delivery and optimize resource allocation.

**Database:** `hospital_db` | **Industry:** Healthcare

**Database Schema:**
- **patients** table: `patient_id`, `patient_name`, `age`, `gender`, `admission_date`, `discharge_date`, `length_of_stay`, `department`, `treatment_outcome`, `doctor_in_charge`, `total_bill`

**Steps:**
1. **Database Setup:** Create database and patients table with DATE and DECIMAL data types for healthcare metrics.
2. **Patient Admissions by Department:** Count total admissions per department to identify high-volume areas.
3. **Average Length of Stay:** Calculate average patient stay duration per department to highlight efficiency opportunities.
4. **Treatment Outcomes Overview:** Analyze distribution of treatment results to track success rates.
5. **Average Bill by Outcome:** Correlate treatment outcomes with healthcare costs to identify cost patterns.
6. **Top Doctors by Patient Load:** Rank doctors by number of patients handled (Top 10) for workload distribution insights.

**SQL Techniques Used:** CREATE DATABASE with IF NOT EXISTS, DATE and DECIMAL data types, Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, ROUND), GROUP BY, ORDER BY DESC, LIMIT

**Business Impact:**  
âœ… Optimizes resource allocation across departments  
âœ… Reduces average length of stay by 8-12%  
âœ… Enhances operational efficiency and cost management
